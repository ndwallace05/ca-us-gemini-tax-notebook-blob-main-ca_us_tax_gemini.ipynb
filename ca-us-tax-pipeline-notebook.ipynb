    "## SOC-2 Controls Checklist (Inline Comments)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Security - Control 1.1 (Access Control):** Ensure all access to this notebook and underlying data sources (GCS, Google Sheets) is properly authenticated and authorized. (Implemented via IAM roles defined in Terraform)\n",
    "*   **Security - Control 1.2 (Data Encryption):** Data at rest in GCS and processed within Colab Enterprise is encrypted using CMEK. (Configured via Terraform and Colab Enterprise settings)\n",
    "*   **Security - Control 1.3 (Change Management):** All changes to this notebook and associated infrastructure are version-controlled (e.g., Git) and follow a formal review process.\n",
    "*   **Security - Control 1.4 (Logging and Monitoring):** Enable comprehensive logging for all operations within this pipeline (e.g., Cloud Logging) and set up monitoring for anomalies.\n",
    "*   **Security - Control 1.5 (Incident Response):** Establish procedures for responding to security incidents related to this pipeline.\n",
    "*   **Availability - Control 2.1 (System Monitoring):** Monitor the availability and performance of the pipeline components (Colab Enterprise, Cloud Scheduler, GCS, Google Sheets).\n",
    "*   **Availability - Control 2.2 (Backup and Recovery):** Implement backup and recovery procedures for critical data and configurations.\n",
    "*   **Processing Integrity - Control 3.1 (Data Accuracy):** Implement validation checks for extracted and transformed data to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "*   **Processing Integrity - Control 3.2 (Completeness):** Ensure all required data is processed and transferred correctly.\n",
    "*   **Processing Integrity - Control 3.3 (Timeliness):** Ensure the pipeline runs according to its schedule (nightly).\n",
    "*   **Confidentiality - Control 4.1 (Data Classification):** Classify tax data as confidential and handle it accordingly.\n",
    "*   **Confidentiality - Control 4.2 (Data Minimization):** Only collect and retain data necessary for the pipeline's function.\n",
    "*   **Privacy - Control 5.1 (Consent):** Ensure appropriate consent is obtained for processing personal tax information.\n",
    "*   **Privacy - Control 5.2 (Data Retention):** Define and enforce data retention policies for tax information.\n",
    "*   **Privacy - Control 5.3 (Data Disposal):** Implement secure disposal methods for tax data when no longer needed."
